## Linear Regression: Predicting Student Final Scores

This project demonstrates the application of **Linear Regression** to predict a student's final exam score based on various demographic features.

### Problem Statement

Educational institutions often seek to identify students at risk of underperforming, allowing for timely intervention. By leveraging historical data and regression analysis, we aim to predict the final scores of students using relevant features such as:

- Attendance records
- Previous test scores
- Study hours
- Participation in extracurricular activities
- Socioeconomic background (optional)

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains student information, including:

- `Hours_Studied`
- `Previous_Scores`
- `Attendance_Percentage`
- `Participation`
- `Final_Score` (target variable)

> **Note:** You can replace or extend these features based on your actual dataset.

### Approach

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   - Load the dataset and inspect for missing values or outliers.
   - Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Building:**  
   - Use scikit-learn’s `LinearRegression` model.
   - Fit the model on the training data.
   - Predict final scores on the test data.

3. **Evaluation:**  
   - Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score.
   - Visualize predictions vs. actual scores.

### Example Code

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('student_scores.csv')

# Features and target
X = data[['Hours_Studied', 'Previous_Scores', 'Attendance_Percentage', 'Participation']]
y = data['Final_Score']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("R² Score:", r2_score(y_test, y_pred))
```

### Results

The model provides predictions for students' final scores, which can help educators identify students needing additional support.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```
